This is an archive of the G6 project, which has been deprecated and is no longer maintained.  
The installer is scraped from the Wayback Machine [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20250129153720/http://www.miniapps.hk/g6code/index.html). The original website can be found [here](https://www.miniapps.hk/g6code/) but is no longer active.  
The custom directory contains my own customisations and addition to the original G6 sqlite dictionary database.  

This repository is currently extended to also host a web rewrite of G6.
